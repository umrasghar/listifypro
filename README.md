# Listify Pro Client

Listify Pro is a web application with a sleek and user-friendly client interface. This README file provides an overview of the client components, technologies used, and instructions for running the client part of the app.

## Technologies Used

Listify Pro's client is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the user interface efficiently with utility classes.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For client-side interactivity and handling API requests.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Listify Pro client on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- A compatible web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone the Listify Pro repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/umrasghar/listifypro.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd listifypro
   ```

### Running the client

To run the Listify Pro client, you don't need any additional setup or server since it's a purely client-side application.

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or using your browser's "Open File" option.

2. You should now see the Listify Pro web app in your browser.

## Usage

Once the client is running, you can use Listify Pro to interact with the property listings, add new properties, report listings, and search for properties using the intuitive user interface.

## Customization

If you want to customize the styling or make changes to the client code, you can do so by editing the HTML, Tailwind CSS classes, and JavaScript files located in the `client` directory.
